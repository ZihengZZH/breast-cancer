# TODO
---
1. WGCDA: Weighted Correlation Network Analysis
2. investigate either feature selection or not
   * #feature >> #samples (resolved by random forest)
3. ~~Random Forest implementaion on RNA-Seq~~
   * tuning hyperparameters (easier)
4. ~~Gradient Boosting Trees implementation on RNA-Seq~~
   * tuning hyperparameters (harder)
   * WHY GBT training way faster then RF
5. Support Vector Classifier implementaion on RNA-Seq
   * tuning hyperparameters 
6. gene signatures + Cox proportional hazard model
7. comparison between different algorithms
8. co-data ??
9. CorEx: Correlation Explanation -- optional
